* Difference from the original MindTheGapps package

- I am a lover of minimalism and hence I reduce as many packages as I can (especially proprietary blobs like GAPPs).
- This repo builds GAPPs automatically if there are updates available on the upstream. It checks for and conditionally
  builds every Sunday.
- My version of MTG has removed the following packages

#+begin_src 
VelvetTitan.apk
Velvet.apk
SpeechServicesByGoogle.apk
talkback.apk
GoogleFeedback.apk
Wellbeing.apk
GooglePartnerSetup.apk
#+end_src

- Which effectively makes my package of gapps only 100-120MB (original size 400-450MB)

* Information
These packages were intended for my personal usage only. However you can use this if you wish on your own risk. 
This repository does not intend in any ways to disrespect original MindTheGapps packaging nor its authors.

* Downloads
All packages can be downloaded from the [[https://github.com/RVSmooth/AutoMTG/releases][Github Releases]]

* Credits
- [[https://gitlab.com/MindTheGapps/][MindTheGapps]] (for creating MTG)
